Title: The Growing Hezbollah Threat to Israels North
Context: Since its founding in 1982, the Shiite terrorist organization's entrenched position in southern Lebanon has posed a continual danger to the lives and wellbeing of both Israeli civilians and security personnel in northern Israel. Over the past 40 years (and, particularly, since Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000), the Hezbollah threat has occasionally escalated into full-blown violence between the Iran-backed terror proxy and Israel's military. The most dramatic example of this is the 2006 Second Lebanon War when the terror group kidnapped two Israeli reservists and directed an unprecedented volley of indiscriminate rocket fire at Israel's northern communities over the course of 34 days.

Context: Such is the spread of Iranian influence today. Although Hezbollah has thousands of sophisticated rockets pointing at all major centers in Israel, it does not want to escalate the restricted skirmishes about border disputes into a major war because it knows quite well that like Hamas, it can be similarly destroyed and, in the process, drag modern Lebanon into the abyss. Similarly, the Houthis are already feeling the American power and may eventually make their cost-benefit analysis and consider abandoning Iran. So, without the help of their proxy fighters and straining under the imposed sanctions and without nuclear weapons, Iran would be in no position to defeat America and Israel.
